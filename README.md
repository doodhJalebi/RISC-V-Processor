# Pipelined RISC V Processor
## Ali Hamza | Owais bin Asad 
Final project for Computer Architecture.

The src folder contains the source code for a RISC-V Processor that can run basic instructions. It can branch but there are a few errors in that. The project is a work in progress and will be completed to be a fully functioning pipelined processor.
